# project1
This is my 1st project using Ansible to automate day to day storage admin tasks.  

For this project I have chosen to use some of the pre-packaged Ansible Storage Modules for a NetApp simulated cluster and write a playbook to create a storage virtual machine (SVM), and volumes for the newly created SVM.  

Requirements to successfully execute the playbook 

  - Ansible 2.5 
  - netapp-lib 
  - NetApp Ontap 8.3.2 Simulator
